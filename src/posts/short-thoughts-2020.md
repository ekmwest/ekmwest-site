Stone and chisel makes sharp letters.

When curiosity is key, expertise is a barrier.

Is this label useful? Is that abstraction relevant? How can you tell?

Trial-and-error requires speed. If the process is slow, you need intelligence.

What should you discuss with your customers? Solutions or problems?

When you say "*we*", do you really know if you're trying to include or exclude?

It is easier to graduate from junior to senior, than to graduate from senior to master. Vanity is a much bigger hurdle than ignorance.

Good designers love design. Great designers love users.

You only respect what you pay for.
