Good intuitions feels exactly the same as bad intuitions.

A mission driven enterprise must be opt-in. A mind that's externally motivated, can never innovate at the highest level.

Focus on context and framing. Trust that solutions will emerge.

Don't try discover new things. Instead, try to discover new ways to discover new things.

A system is complex (or not), in and of itself. But a system can also be judged from an epistemic perspective: If you don't know anything about a system, it might <em>appear</em> complex, even though it isn't. Make sure to understand the difference.

A solution is a piece that only can be found by exploring the puzzle.

Being uncertain and doubtful is a powerful skill.

Don't announce the answer you found. Show the path to the place where you found the question.

Confidence don't cause skill. Skill cause confidence. Surprisingly, this is rarely understood.

Pessimism undermines trust in established models, and creates markets for new opinions, theories, and cults.

When you compete, you're playing by someone else's rules.
