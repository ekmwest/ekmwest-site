<div class="short-thoughts">

No fact has ever been expressed without a motive.

Don't say sorry I'm late. Say thank you for waiting.

First-principles thinking is useless in complex environments.

Does your value come from you being right?

Don't remember to say thank you. Remember to be greateful.

You can't wake someone who's pretending to be asleep.

Creativity comes from friction, limitations, and troubles. What would you create if there were no needs or problems?

Telling others to wake up doesn't mean you're not sleeping.

Keep the promises you make to yourself.

If I don't know you, how could I give you advice?

Ignore time. Appreciate moments.
