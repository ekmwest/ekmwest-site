No fact has been ever expressed without a motive.

Don't say sorry I'm late. Say thank you for waiting.

First-principles thinking is useless in complex environments.

Does your value come from you being right? Red flag.

Don't remember to say thank you. Remember to be greateful.

You can't wake a person who is pretending to be asleep.

Ignore time. Appreciate moments.
