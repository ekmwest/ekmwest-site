It looks like the sun is orbiting earth.

Or does it?

*What would it have looked like* if it was the other way around? What would it have looked like if earth was spinning around the sun?

Does it look like that other train is moving â€” or does it look like it's *your* train that's moving? What exactly is your perception telling you?

Your friend might seem closed-minded when dismissing a topic you want to discuss. But perhaps it's you that's dismissing your friend's dismissal.

Telling others to *"wake up"* doesn't mean you're not sleeping.

Ask yourself, if the inverse of your preception was true, what would it have looked like?
