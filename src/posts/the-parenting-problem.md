The purpose of parenting is teaching children how to become successful. The problem is, success cannot be taught:

1. By their own estimate, most parents aren't successful.
2. Successful parents don't really understand what made them successful.
3. Whatever made them successful is not relevant today.
4. Whatever made them successful is not relevant to their children.
5. Their children have a different definition of success.
6. Their children don't want to be taught.

The Parenting Problem is not limited to parenting. It applies to mentoring and teaching in general.
