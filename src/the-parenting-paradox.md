The purpose of parenting is teaching children how to become successful. Paradoxically, success cannot be taught.

1. By their own estimate, most parents aren't successful.
2. Successful parents don't truly understand what made them successful.
3. Whatever made them successful is not relevant today.
4. Whatever made them successful is not relevant to their children.
5. Their children have a different definition of success.
6. Their children don't want to be taught.

The Parenting Paradox is not limited to parenting. It applies to advicing and counseling in general.
