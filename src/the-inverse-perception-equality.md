# The Inverse Perception Equality

It looks like the sun is rotating around earth.

Or does it?

What *would* it have looked like if the inverse was true — what would it have looked like if earth was rotating around the sun?

Does it look like that other train is moving — or does it look like it's *your* train that's moving? What exactly is your perception telling you?

Your friend might seem closed-minded when dismissing a book you want to discuss. What if the book is crap? Are you dismissing your friend's dismissal?

Telling others to "*wake up*" doesn't mean you're not sleeping.

Ask yourself, if the inverse to your preception was true, what would it have looked like?
