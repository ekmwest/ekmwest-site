<h1>The Parenting Paradox</h1>

<h6>13 Dec 2020</h6>

<p>The purpose of parenting is teaching children how to become successful. Paradoxically, success cannot be taught.</p>

<ol>
    <li>By their own estimate, most parents aren't successful.</li>
    <li>Successful parents don't truly understand what made them successful.</li>
    <li>Whatever made them successful is not relevant today.</li>
    <li>Whatever made them successful is not relevant to their children.</li>
    <li>Their children have a different definition of success.</li>
    <li>Their children don't want to be taught, they want to find out for themselves.</li>
</ol>

<p>The paradox is not limited to parenting. It applies to advice and counseling in general.</p>
