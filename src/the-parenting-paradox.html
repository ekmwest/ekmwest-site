<h1>The Parenting Paradox</h1>

<h6>13 Dec 2020</h6>

<p>The purpose of parenting is teaching the kids how to become successful. Paradoxically, success cannot be taught.</p>

<p>It's not difficult to teach success. It's impossible.</p>

<ul>
    <li>By their own estimate, most parents aren't successful</li>
    <li>Successful parents don't understand what made them successful</li>
    <li>Whatever made them successful, does not apply today</li>
    <li>Whatever made them successful, is not what their kids need to become successful</li>
    <li>What even is success?</li>
</ul>



<h2>The Solution</h2>

<p>The gate to heaven is sealed in paradox. The key, in this case, as in many others, lies in our mental models.</p>

<p>What is teaching? Is it transmitting knowledge, or creating an enviroment for learning.</p>

<p>Ge barnen kärlek, mera kärlek och ännu mera kärlek, så kommer folkvettet av sig själv.</p>
