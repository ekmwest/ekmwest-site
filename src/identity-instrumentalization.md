# Identity Instrumentalization

Identity is valuable only as a goal. As something to aspire to become.

Once achieved, and recognized by professional peers, identity becomes shackles.



But once you've reach a certain level, once you've become what you want to become, your identity will confine you.

You must shred your identity and transform it to an instrument.

Once you've become a leader, you must begin thinking of leadership as an instrument to serve others.

You have to run to stand still.
