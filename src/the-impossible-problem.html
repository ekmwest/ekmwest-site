<h1>The Impossible Problem</h1>

<h6>1 Nov 2020</h6>

<p>My dad has lots of folders. One of them have interesting problems. Each summer he shows me a couple of them. Last year he showed me "The Impossible problem":</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>
        This beautiful problem, which I call "impossible" because it seems to lack sufficient information for a solution, began making the rounds of mathematics meetings a year or so ago. I do not know its origin. Mel Stover of Winnipeg was the first to call it to my attention.
    </p>
    <p>
        Two numbers (not necessarily different) are chosen from the range of possible integers greater than 1 and not greater than 100. Only the rum of the two numbers is given to mathematiciean <em>S</em>. Only the product of the two is given to mathematician <em>P</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the telephone <em>S</em> says to <em>P</em>: "I see no way you can determine my sum."
    </p>
    <p>
        An hour later <em>P</em> calls back to say: "I know your sum."
    </p>
    <p>
        Later <em>S</em> calls <em>P</em> again to report: "Now I know your product."
    </p>
    <p>
        What are the two numbers?
    </p>

    I like this problem because we have to start with what we don't know. Everything interesting start with not knowing.

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>
    <strong>(1)</strong> For <em>S</em> to make the first phone call, the sum must not be possible to create from two numbers that are both prime. If both numbers could be primes, <em>P</em> would've been able to determine the sum.
</p>

<p>
    For example, the sum cannot be 10. The sum 10 can be created by 3 and 7 and they are both prime. The product 21 would determine both numbers and and <em>P</em> could easily determine the numbers and the sum.
</p>

<p>
    The sum could be 11. There is no way to create that sum from two numbers that are both prime.

    <strong>(2)</strong> For <em>P</em> to make the second phone call,
