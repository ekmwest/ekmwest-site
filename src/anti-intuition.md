If you work in a complex environment like business, product design, or finance, you shouldn't trust your intuition.

Intuition is an efficient unconsious pattern reconition mechanism.

Your intuition can be correct or wrong, but it feels the exact same way in both situations.  You feel confident that you're correct.

You can improve your intuition by not trusting it.

Study complex and surprising fields to improve your anti-intuition. Study linguistics rather than grammar. Study ecosystems rather than genetics.

When you study linguistics and ecosystems enough, you will learn that your assumptions and intuitions are frequently wrong. Try to improve this spontanous reaction. When you feel like you know something, you should immediately become suspicious. This is anti-intuition.
