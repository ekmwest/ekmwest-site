<h1>The Parenting Paradox</h1>
<p>The purpose of parenting is teaching children how to become successful. Paradoxically, success cannot be taught.</p>
<ol>
<li>By their own estimate, most parents aren&#39;t successful.</li>
<li>Successful parents don&#39;t truly understand what made them successful.</li>
<li>Whatever made them successful is not relevant today.</li>
<li>Whatever made them successful is not relevant to their children.</li>
<li>Their children have a different definition of success.</li>
<li>Their children don&#39;t want to be taught.</li>
</ol>
<p>This paradox is not limited to parenting. It applies to advicing and counseling in general.</p>
