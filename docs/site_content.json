Intuition is an efficient unconsious pattern reconition mechanism. Your intuition can be correct or wrong, but it feels the exact same way in both situations. You feel confident that you&#39;re correct. You can improve your intuition by not trusting it. Study complex and surprising fields to improve your anti-intuition. Study linguistics rather than grammar. Study ecosystems rather than genetics. When you study linguistics and ecosystems enough, you will learn that your assumptions and intuitions are frequently wrong. Try to improve this spontanous reaction. When you feel like you know something, you should immediately become suspicious. This is anti-intuition."

Once achieved, and recognized by professional peers, identity becomes shackles. But once you&#39;ve reach a certain level, once you&#39;ve become what you want to become, your identity will confine you. You must shred your identity and transform it to an instrument. Once you&#39;ve become a leader, you must begin thinking of leadership as an instrument to serve others. You have to run to stand still."

First-principles thinking is useless in complex environments. Does your value come from you being right? Red flag. Don&#39;t remember to say thank you. Remember to be greateful. You can&#39;t wake a person who is pretending to be asleep. Creativity comes from friction, limitations, and troubles. What would you create if there were no needs and no problems? Telling others to wake up doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re not sleeping. Confidence is about keeping the promises you make to yourself. If you don&#39;t know me, how could you give me advice? Ignore time.

How can you tell? Seek people with different perspectives. Avoid people with different motives. Trial-and-error requires speed. If the process is slow, you need intelligence. What should you discuss with your customers? Solutions or problems? When you say &quot;we&quot;, are you trying to include or exclude? It is easier to graduate from junior to senior, than to graduate from senior to master. Vanity is a bigger hurdle than ignorance. Good designers love design. Great designers love users. Light requires darkness. The midwit, looking down at the edges, sees no difference between masters and idiots. You only respect what you pay for."

A mind that&#39;s externally motivated, can never innovate at the highest level. Focus on context and framing. Trust that solutions will emerge. Don&#39;t try discover new things. Instead, try to discover new ways to discover new things. A system is complex (or not), in and of itself. But a system can also be judged from an epistemic perspective: If you don&#39;t know anything about a system, it might appear complex, even though it isn&#39;t. Make sure to understand the difference. A solution is a piece that only can be found by exploring the puzzle. Being uncertain and doubtful is a powerful skill. Don&#39;t announce the answer you found. Show the path to the place where you found the question. Confidence don&#39;t cause skill. Skill cause confidence. Surprisingly, this is rarely understood. Pessimism undermines trust in established models, and creates markets for new opinions, theories, and cults. When you compete, you&#39;re playing by someone else&#39;s rules."

Originality is important for branding, but harmful for usability. Are you trying to create conformity or creativity? You don&#39;t understand what you see. You see what you understand. Prototype to learn. Don&#39;t try to figure it out. Try to figure out how to figure it out. It&#39;s not about how much you know, it&#39;s about how fast you learn. Compete with kids instead of experts. Everything is good in some contexts, and bad in others. The first question should always be: What is the right question? There are two kind of designers — those that care about users, and those that believe they care about users. If you&#39;re certain that you&#39;re of the first kind, then you&#39;re probably not. Always gather more perspectives. Kindness is partly a decision, but primarily a skill. This is profoundly counterintuitive and rarely understood. Don&#39;t try to understand reality. Instead, try to understand how your perspective shapes the way you understand reality. The master walks his own path. If you want to follow the master, find your own path."

        "content": "April 29, 2021 The Communist Mistake The Communist Mistake is to assume that facts can be known. Planned economy is a clarifying example. No person or organization can predict the complex interactions between capital, resources, labor, intellectual property, and distribution. Planned economy is a mistake because it assumes that facts about the future can be known. A market economy isn&#39;t planned. It&#39;s not based on facts. Technological advancements, and changes in consusumer demands, are met by opportunistic companies. Each individual company has a plan of course. But the market itself doesn&#39;t. Clearly, in many situations, facts can be known. The sun will rise tomorrow and you&#39;re reading this paragraph right now. But be aware — looks can be decieving. Newton&#39;s law of gravity describes a simple relationship between moving bodies, but a system with more than just two bodies is impossible to analytically predict. What looks simple might not be so. There&#39;s no reason to expect that the universe should behave in an analytically predictable manner. You should expect the opposite. Assume that no plan survives contact with the enemy. Assume that facts can&#39;t be known. Don&#39;t make the Communist Mistake."

The problem is, success cannot be taught: By their own estimate, most parents aren&#39;t successful. Successful parents don&#39;t really understand what made them successful. Whatever made them successful is not relevant today. Whatever made them successful is not relevant to their children. Their children have a different definition of success. Their children don&#39;t want to be taught. The Parenting Problem is not limited to parenting. It applies to mentoring and teaching in general."
