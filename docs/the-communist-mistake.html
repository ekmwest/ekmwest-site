<h1>The Communist Mistake</h1>
<p>The Communist Mistake is to assume that facts can be known.</p>
<p><em>Planned economy</em> is a clarifying example. No person or organization can predict the complex interactions between capital, resources, labor, intellectual property, and distribution. Planned economy is a mistake because it assumes that facts about the future can be known.</p>
<p>A <em>market economy</em> isn&#39;t planned. It&#39;s not based on facts. Technological advancements, and changes in consusumer demands, are met by opportunistic companies. Each individual company has a plan of course. But the market itself doesn&#39;t.</p>
<p>Obviously, facts can be known in some situations. The sun will rise tomorrow and you&#39;re reading this post right now. But be aware â€” looks can be decieving. Newton&#39;s law of gravity describes a simple relationship between bodies. But a system with more than two bodies is impossible to analytically predict. What looks simple might not be so.</p>
<p>There&#39;s no reason to expect that the universe should behave in an analytically predictable manner. Expect the opposite. Assume that no plan survives contact with the enemy. Assume that fact can&#39;t be known.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t make the Communist Mistake. </p>
