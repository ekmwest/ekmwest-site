<h1>The Communist Mistake</h1>
<p>The Communist Mistake is to assume that facts can be known.</p>
<p><em>Planned economy</em> is an instructive example. No person or organization can predict the complex interactions between capital, resources, labor, intellectual property, and distribution. Planned economy is a mistake because it assumes that facts about the future can be known.</p>
<p>A <em>market economy</em> isn&#39;t planned. It&#39;s not based on facts. Technological advancements, and changes in consusumer demands, are met by opportunistic companies.</p>
<p>Of course, every company has a plan. Every company must act on assumptions about facts. But the market doesn&#39;t. A market economy doesn&#39;t assume that facts can be known. And that&#39;s why it works.</p>
<p>In some situations, fact can be known. The sun will rise tomorrow and you&#39;re reading this post right now. But be aware. Looks can be decieving. Newton&#39;s law of gravity describes a simple relationship between bodies. But a system with just more than two bodies is impossible to predict analytically. What looks simple might not be so.</p>
<p>There&#39;s no reason to expect that the universe should behave in an analytically predictable manner. Expect the opposite. Assume that no plan survives contact with the enemy. Assume that fact can&#39;t be known.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t make the communist mistake. </p>
