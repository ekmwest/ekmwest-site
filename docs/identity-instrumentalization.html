<h1>Identity Instrumentalization</h1>
<p>Identity is valuable only as a goal. As something to aspire to become.</p>
<p>Once achieved, and recognized by professional peers, identity becomes shackles.</p>
<p>But once you&#39;ve reach a certain level, once you&#39;ve become what you want to become, your identity will confine you.</p>
<p>You must shred your identity and transform it to an instrument.</p>
<p>Once you&#39;ve become a leader, you must begin thinking of leadership as an instrument to serve others.</p>
<p>You have to run to stand still.</p>
