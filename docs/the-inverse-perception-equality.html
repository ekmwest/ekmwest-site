<h1>The Inverse Perception Equality</h1>
<p>It looks like the sun is rotating around earth.</p>
<p>Or does it?</p>
<p>What <em>would</em> it have looked like if the inverse was true — what would it have looked like if earth was rotating around the sun?</p>
<p>Does it look like that other train is moving — or does it look like it&#39;s <em>your</em> train that&#39;s moving? What exactly is your perception telling you?</p>
<p>Your friend might seem closed-minded when dismissing a book you want to discuss. What if the book is crap? Are you dismissing your friend&#39;s dismissal?</p>
<p>Telling others to &quot;<em>wake up</em>&quot; doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re not sleeping.</p>
<p>Ask yourself, if the inverse to your preception was true, what would it have looked like?</p>
