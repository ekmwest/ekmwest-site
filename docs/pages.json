Once achieved, and recognized by professional peers, identity becomes shackles. But once you&#39;ve reach a certain level, once you&#39;ve become what you want to become, your identity will confine you. You must shred your identity and transform it to an instrument. Once you&#39;ve become a leader, you must begin thinking of leadership as an instrument to serve others. You have to run to stand still."

        "content": "ekmwest APRIL 29, 2021 The Communist Mistake The Communist Mistake is to assume that facts can be known. Planned economy is a clarifying example. No person or organization can predict the complex interactions between capital, resources, labor, intellectual property, and distribution. Planned economy is a mistake because it assumes that facts about the future can be known. A market economy isn&#39;t planned. It&#39;s not based on facts. Technological advancements, and changes in consusumer demands, are met by opportunistic companies. Each individual company has a plan of course. But the market itself doesn&#39;t. Clearly, in many situations, facts can be known. The sun will rise tomorrow and you&#39;re reading this paragraph right now. But be aware — looks can be decieving. Newton&#39;s law of gravity describes a simple relationship between bodies. But a system with more than two bodies is impossible to analytically predict. What looks simple might not be so. There&#39;s no reason to expect that the universe should behave in an analytically predictable manner. Expect the opposite. Assume that no plan survives contact with the enemy. Assume that fact can&#39;t be known. Don&#39;t make the Communist Mistake."

What would it have looked like if the inverse was true — if earth was orbiting the sun? Does it look like that other train is moving — or does it look like it&#39;s your train that&#39;s moving? What exactly is your perception telling you? Your friend might seem closed-minded when dismissing a book you want to discuss. What if the book is crap? Are you dismissing your friend&#39;s dismissal? Telling others to &quot;wake up&quot; doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re not sleeping. Ask yourself, if the inverse to your preception was true, what would it have looked like?"

By their own estimate, most parents aren&#39;t successful. Successful parents don&#39;t truly understand what made them successful. Whatever made them successful is not relevant today. Whatever made them successful is not relevant to their children. Their children have a different definition of success. Their children don&#39;t want to be taught. The Parenting Paradox is not limited to parenting. It applies to advicing and counseling in general."
